### 01. WHAT IS A CMS

Welcome to Wordpress Essentials. My name is Daine; Im the supervisor for all things web here at Friends of Design, and I will be guiding you through - for some of you - will be your first encounter with Wordpress. Wordpress is a CMS or Content Management System that allows your to create incredibly dynamic blogs and websites with ease. Note; that you will be learning a new language in this course which goes by the name of PHP.

Dont be frightened, it sounds scary, but it actually isnt.

If you have any questions during the duration of the course, please feel free to email me at daine@friendsofdesign.net. Lets get started...

**Heres a wiki for CMS:**

A content management system \(CMS\)is a computer program that allows publishing, editing and modifying content as well as maintenance from a central interface. Such systems of content management provide procedures to manage workflow in a collaborative environment. These procedures can be manual steps or an automated cascade. CMSs have been available since the late 1990s.

CMSs are often used to run websites containing blogs, news, and shopping. Many corporate and marketing websites use CMSs. CMSs typically aim to avoid the need for hand coding but may support it for specific elements or entire pages.

More importantly: A web content management system \(web CMS\) is a bundled or stand-alone application to create, manage, store and deploy content on Web pages. Web content includes text and embedded graphics, photos, video, audio, and code \(e.g., for applications\) that displays content or interacts with the user.

A web CMS may catalog and index content, select or assemble content at runtime, or deliver content to specific visitors in a requested way, such as other languages. Web CMSs usually allow client control over HTML-based content, files, documents, and web hosting plans based on the system depth and the niche it serves.

As you can see from the abobe definitions, CMS’s are there to help us manage content without us having to hard-code client side languages all day long. They basically make our lives a lot easier. 

In context to Wordpress, the CMS has grown so much that managing blog posts is one of its very basic operations: ecommerce, forums, restaurant bookings, courses and lessons, the list is virtually endless. If you have the right plugins and themes you can make wordpress do just about anything for you - and when I say “do” I mean, manage.

### 02. ALTERNATIVE CMS

Wordpress is a popular CMS for many reasons like we’ve discussed, but that doesnt mean its the only one. Each CMS has its own strengths and weaknesses. One thing developers find incredibly frustrating with Wordpress is its link management, having to constantly add PHP functions to create dynamic links.

**Examples of other open-source CMS are:**

* Drupal \(www.drupal.org\)
* Joomla \(www.joomla.org\)
* Magento \(www.magento.com\)

These sites, save for Magento which is a ecommerce CMS, have been around for a while and many developers still use them. You can visit the links below and compare dashboards. The point is, that a lot of these CMS work on the same principles and concepts that Wordpress does, they’ve just gone about it in a different way, maybe using differnt languages Ruby instead of PHP for example. There is no better or king CMS out there - it really boils down to how comfortable you are in your skill and what you need to accomplish.

### 03. WHY USE WORDPRESS

In terms of userbility, customization, support, popularity and its level of dynamic ability - Wordpress seems to trump all CMS’s with relative ease. Websites like Themeforest supply thousands of professionally coded Wordpess Themes which are so powerful that its not very often that you need to write code.

Like we’ve discussed before - Wordpress has so much support for beginners as well as advanced users. They’ve even gone as far as to invite anyone who thinks they are up to it to contribute to the Wordpress Codex \(you will hear the word “codex” come up a lot, its a fancy name for core\) if you put in the time and effort to understanding this CMS it will yield you amazing results.

It takes time though, it is so dynamic that literally anything you could think of creating can be made in reality if you understand the languages at work.

### 04. WEB TECHNOLOGIES

Wordpress works on a 5 main langauges. These languages are split up into to categories:

1. Server
2. Frontend

**Frontend**

As a striving web designer you should all know HTML and CSS - the building blocks for any website that is read by a modern day browser. If you were really cutting edge you might understand a bit of javascript or jQuery too, simply for interactivty reasons - but now with the advent of CSS3 some jQuery has become redundant. Its very important to understand how these languages integrate with each other. A thorough understanding of HTML and CSS is required to complete this course. We wont be using Javascript, but an understanding is always helpful as you will see similiarties in its syntax when we tackle PHP.

**Server**

PHP runs on the server - its not a frontend langauge. You cant see it in the browser and it will never show you exactly what its doing. The entire Wordpress CMS is bult using PHP. When we speak about PHP we refer to it as a server-side langauge. Its the messenger boy that carries out functions and stores information in variables. You can think of it like the glue of Wordpress. Its a very strict and fragile language, meaning if you leave out a semi-colon somewhere, you work is going to dissapear.

PHP is also very fond of MySQL - which isnt a language in itself but it uses what is called SQL queries. MySQL is effectively a database software that talks to the front end of websites using PHP. PHP integrates seamlessly with HTML, allowing you, as the user to embed specific PHP code that communicates with the database via the Wordpress core. This will all become a lot easier to understand when we’ve taken a deeper look at it all.

This course spans over 4 weeks. I urge every single one of you to put in time over weekends or during the day if your lifestyle allows for it, to touch up on any HTML and CSS, and if you’re brave enough, jump onto webistes like CodeAcademy and give the PHP

Essentials course a go, it will dramatically help you through this course.



### 05. WORDPRESS IN INDUSTRY

Wordpress started off as an open source blogging tool. In fact, it is still an open source blogging tool. We’re currently on version 3.9 of Wordpress - 3.8 being a major release of UI, operations and functionality. Wordpress is owned by Automatttic. The company was started by a gentleman named Matt Mullenweg.

So, Why is Wordpress so popular? Well, theres a number of reasons. First of all, its free! Yup, no cash required to download the install files. They’re free and always available on wordpress.org. Wordpress is also very dynamic, its very light-weight and runs on opensource, community driven languages like HTML, CSS, MySQL and PHP.

There is a gigantic community of web developers and designers who are Wordpress. Plenty of websites, blogs and forums like Stack Exchange offer support for new users of Wordpress, as well as Automattic themselves with there integrated community tab on their website. Wordpress also comes in two flavours: wordpress.org \(which we’ll be using\) and wordpress.com - Now, we wont be going near wordpress.com in this course, not because its bad or unwarranted, but because theres no way of customizing it to our needs. It doesnt provide any access to core files, or theme customization.

What you really have is a Tumblr or Blogger on your hands, and that is great for the individuals who couldnt care less about code. Wordpress is so popular that they host yearly meetings called Wordcamps - we had one in Cape Town last year.

**Here’s some cool stats:**

1. As of March 2012 there are currently 72.4 million websites using Wordpress as their CMS of choice.
2. There has been 98 releases of the Wordpress core to date.
3. Top Companies using Wordpress? BBC, Top Gear, National Geographic, CNN, New York Times, NFL, HONDA.
4. It is the most popular CMS on the planet, beating Drupal and Joomla.
5. Wordpress.com is the 18th most popular blogging tool in the UK.
6. 22 of every 100 new domains in the US are running Wordpress.
7. In Indonesia - Wordpress.com is the 8th most popular website
8. There are 37 Million Wordpress related searches every Month.
9. In the first week of March 2012 - 826,000 Youtube videos were embedded into Wordpress sites.
10. Wordpress is natively integrated with: Facebook, Twitter, Soundcloud, Google Maps and Vimeo.
11. Currently - Wordpress owns 53.8% of the CMS Market

* Joomla 9.2%
* Drupal 6.2%
* Others 30.3%

Theres two main ways to implement wordpress.

1. Theme Development
2. Customizing pre-bought themes.

The second version is most common in developing markets. Although it is common knowledge that people do this with hardly any web design skills, you can only go so far.

**Theme Development**

This is the hardcore, coding intensive, team-requiring effort of very experience web designers and developers. Its one thing creating a personal blog - as Wordpress natively supports such functions and callbacks - however, when you see wordpress templates that move away from blogs and become actual dynamic websites with portfolios, effects, animations etc, they has deviated away from the “core-purpose” of Wordpress, manipulating its open source frame work to satisfy their needs. Its quite genius if you think about it, but it requires many many years of experience to create something that intricate and dynamic.

Clients will also pay thousands of rands to have their own website moved across to Wordpress, maybe they had implemented a static HTML/CSS/Javascript site previous, or maybe they were running on Joomla,because these CMS all use databases and server-side script, an experienced web developer can make the transition with relative ease.

**Customization**

This is a particular gap in the Wordpress market, theme authors, like those on Themeforest design themes for users that they can pay and download and then use on their particular client site. Lets take an example, you get a freelance client asking for a website for their restaurant. After assertaining what the client wants - menu, reservations, background slider, you can jump on to Themeforest and use the keyword “restaurant” to find all Wordpress themes tagged with “restaurant” You can then narrow down options that contain all of the above requirements, a little bit of customization, colour and font changes and alignment with the brand identity and you can sometimes get what is a completely different looking theme.

Clients are happy as it looks professional \(depending on your skill of course\) and they pay you a very nice sum of money as they can manage the website themselves using Wordpress’ simple Dashboard.

That being said, there is a standard good practice for theme customisation which we will go through in the 3rd week of this course.

### 06. RESOURCES

I am continually adding resources to my Delicious page online if you guys would like to access some of the resources I have there. I will populate it during the course as I take you to each site and show you what will help and what wont.

Your biggest and baddest friend will always be the Wordpress Codex [codex.wordpress.org](http://codex.wordpress.org)

Its more of a dictionary than a walkthrough guide, but you will start to understand it a bit better as we go along.

### 07. EXERCISES

1. Research the available CMS on the internet, and also try and discover any new CMS that are up and coming and may be useful to you in the future.
